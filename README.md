# Jerod Michel's Syntax and Semantics

###  About Jerod Michel
My interests include combinatorics, information theory and linguistics. I am currently a Lecturer (TT) in the Mathematics Department at Nanjing Univeristy of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China. This repo is the beginning of a discussion on syntax and semantics of both computer languages and natural languages.

    > The familiar saying that the exception proves the rule contains a good deal of 
    > wisdom, though from the standpoint of formal logic it became an absurdity as 
    > soon as "prove" no longer meant "put on trial." The old saying began to be 
    > profound psychology from the time it ceased to have standing in logic. What it 
    > might well suggest to us today is that, if a rule has absolutely no exceptions, 
    > it is not recognized as a rule or as anything else; it is then part of the 
    > background of experience of which we tend to remain unconscious. Never having 
    > experienced anything in contrast to it, we cannot isolate it and formulate it 
    > as a rule until we so enlarge our experience and expand our base of reference 
    > that we encounter an interruption of its regularity. The situation is somewhat 
    > analogous to that of not missing the water till the well runs dry, or not 
    > realizing that we need air till we are choking.
